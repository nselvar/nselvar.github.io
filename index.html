          R - Neural Network & SVM - Predict Success Of Bank Telemarketing
        </div>
        <div class='card-section-text-description'>
          The shift towards decision making (DM) based on
          machine learning techniques  techniques will change the way in which
          consumer markets and our societies function. Through ML, predictive
          analytics is being used by businesses to identify these patterns and
          major trends with the objective to improve the DM and influence
          future business outcomes. This project proposes an  Neural
          Network (ANN)/ SVM approach to predict the success of telemarketing
          calls for selling bank long-term deposits. To validate the proposed
          model, we uses the bank marketing data of 41188 phone calls. The
          NN attains 90% of accuracy which outperforms other
          conventional classifiers and confirms that it is credible and valuable
          approach for telemarketing campaign managers.

          R - Naive Bayes - Validating Yelp Food Establishment Ratings based
          on Reviews.
        </div>
        <div class='card-section-text-description'>
          We are living in a review-obsessed culture and, when we are looking for a place have lunch or have dinner, it has now become a common reflex
          to check online ratings before making a final call.It is obvious that a restaurant with poor rating will probably face serious
          business issues and maybe have to stop its activity. By building Rating Prediction which will relate text based feedback to a star rating,
          we can help these restaurants understand how they would rate
          on Yelp .Our approach is to use Naive Bayes classifier and  build a text classifier which predicts the number of stars given by the user based
          on the review text.

         R - KNN - Predicting Song Popularity using Spotify Dataset
        </div>
        <div class='card-section-text-description'>

          Why Do Some Songs Become Popular? DJ Khaled boldly claimed to always know when a song will be a hit.
          We decided to further investigate by asking three key questions: Are there certain characteristics for hit songs, what
          are the largest influencers on a songâ€™s success, and can old songs even predict the popularity of new songs? Predicting
          how popular a song will be  no easy task. To answer these questions, we made use of the Spotify song dataset, and used
          KNN machine learning to build a model with 85% accuracy.

          Deep Learning for NLP: Twitter Sentimental Analysis
        </div>
        <div class='card-section-text-description'>

          Obtaining feedback from a few of the customers is easy. However, imagine that you could ask the whole world! You
          would know immediately the general opinion and could react accordingly. This machine learning solution examines twitter
          data  for their tonality. The classification, whether a tweet is positive or negative, i.e. the tonality, is
          done by a deep neural network. The deep convolutional neural network architecture we constructed in this project,is a
          feedforward neural net using the TensorFlow library in Python. The neural network classifies tweet vectors in negative or
          positive using the  Bag of Words model,ReLU activation function and softmax activation function, which will classify the
          tweet to either positive or negative.<a class='noDeco'  href="/twitter-sentimental-analytics"><i>Click here for code and detailed report.</i>

          Predicting video game hits with Machine Learning : Hundreds of new games launch every month. Yet only a fraction of makes their way to the top.
          If you ever wondered what makes a video game a bestseller, now you have a full overview of factors that make its breakout success.
          In this project, I will analyze sales data from 8K video games, identify variables most correlated to hits (games which sell over 1M units) and
          implement a prediction model using machine learning algorithms to separate winners from losers.<a class='noDeco' href="/video-game-analysis">

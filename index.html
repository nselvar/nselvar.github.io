          Predicting video game hits with Machine Learning : Hundreds of new games launch every month. Yet only a fraction of makes their way to the top.
          If you ever wondered what makes a video game a bestseller, now you have a full overview of factors that make its breakout success.
          In this project, I will analyze sales data from 8K video games, identify variables most correlated to hits (games which sell over 1M units) and
          implement a prediction model using machine learning algorithms to separate winners from losers.<a class='noDeco' href="/video-game-analysis">

          Deep Learning for NLP: Twitter Sentimental Analysis

          Obtaining feedback from a few of the customers is easy. However, imagine that you could ask the whole world! You
          would know immediately the general opinion and could react accordingly. This machine learning solution examines twitter
          data  for their tonality. The classification, whether a tweet is positive or negative, i.e. the tonality, is
          done by a deep neural network. The deep convolutional neural network architecture we constructed in this project,is a
          feedforward neural net using the TensorFlow library in Python. The neural network classifies tweet vectors in negative or
          positive using the  Bag of Words model,ReLU activation function and softmax activation function, which will classify the
          tweet to either positive or negative.<a class='noDeco'  href="/twitter-sentimental-analytics"><i>Click here for code and detailed report.</i>

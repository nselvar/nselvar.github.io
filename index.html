        AWS Rekognition and Java to Identify Objects / Text in Images
      </div>
      <div class='card-section-text-description'>
        Amazon Rekognition is an Amazon Web Service (AWS) that provides image and video analysis services.
        You can provide an image or video and the service will detect objects, people and scenes.
        The purpose of Rekognition is to analyze images and predict what objects are in the image,
        if there are any faces, transcribe text, and other tasks.In this post, we can see the
        demo of AWS Rekognition which using  both custom model & predefined models.

          Deep Learning for NLP: Twitter Sentimental Analysis in Python
        </div>
        <div class='card-section-text-description'>

          Obtaining feedback from a few of the customers is easy. However, imagine that you could ask the whole world! You
          would know immediately the general opinion and could react accordingly. This machine learning solution examines twitter
          data  for their tonality. The classification, whether a tweet is positive or negative, i.e. the tonality, is
          done by a deep neural network. The deep convolutional neural network architecture we constructed in this project,is a
          feedforward neural net using the TensorFlow library in Python. The neural network classifies tweet vectors in negative or
          positive using the  Bag of Words model,ReLU activation function and softmax activation function, which will classify the
          tweet to either positive or negative.<a class='noDeco'  href="/twitter-sentimental-analytics"><i>Click here for code and detailed report.</i>

          Real Time Stock Market Prediction - Neural Network, ARIMA, RandomForest, SVM, DecisionTree
        </div>
        <div class='card-section-text-description'>
          According to the forecast of stock price trends, investors trade stocks. In recent years, many researchers focus
          on adopting machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict stock price trends. In this work, Artificial Neural Network
          /ARIMA / Random Forest / SVM/ Decision Tree techniques have been utilized for predicting the next day closing price
          for  companies in real time.To achieve this goal, we trained traditional machine learning algorithms and created/trained
          multiple deep learning models taking into consideration the importance of the stock indicators & historical data.

          Ability to recognize and track frequent item sets in data help businesses
          shift through the layers of seemingly unrelated data for meaningful
          relationships. Apriori algorithm is
          one of the most popular data mining approach for finding frequent item sets
          from a transaction dataset and derive association rules.
          Rules are the discovered knowledge from the data base.
          Once frequent item sets are obtained,it is straightforward to generate association rules with confidence larger than or equal to a user
          specified minimum confidence.In this post we can explore how to find association rules and formulate some predictions for the online store.

        R - Neural Network & SVM - Predict Success Of Bank Telemarketing

      <div class='card-section-text-description'>
        The shift towards decision making (DM) based on
        machine learning techniques  techniques will change the way in which
        consumer markets and our societies function. Through ML, predictive
        analytics is being used by businesses to identify these patterns and
        major trends with the objective to improve the DM and influence
        future business outcomes. This project proposes an  Neural
        Network (ANN)/ SVM approach to predict the success of telemarketing
        calls for selling bank long-term deposits. To validate the proposed
        model, we uses the bank marketing data of 41188 phone calls. The
        NN attains 90% of accuracy which outperforms other
        conventional classifiers and confirms that it is credible and valuable
        approach for telemarketing campaign managers.

        R - Naive Bayes - Validating Yelp Food Establishment Ratings based

      <div class='card-section-text-description'>
        We are living in a review-obsessed culture and, when we are looking for a place have lunch or have dinner, it has now become a common reflex
        to check online ratings before making a final call.It is obvious that a restaurant with poor rating will probably face serious
        business issues and maybe have to stop its activity. By building Rating Prediction which will relate text based feedback to a star rating,
        we can help these restaurants understand how they would rate
        on Yelp .Our approach is to use Naive Bayes classifier and  build a text classifier which predicts the number of stars given by the user based
        on the review text.

        R - KNN - Predicting Song Popularity using Spotify Dataset
      </div>
      <div class='card-section-text-description'>

        Why Do Some Songs Become Popular? DJ Khaled boldly claimed to always know when a song will be a hit.
        We decided to further investigate by asking three key questions: Are there certain characteristics for hit songs, what
        are the largest influencers on a song’s success, and can old songs even predict the popularity of new songs? Predicting
        how popular a song will be  no easy task. To answer these questions, we made use of the Spotify song dataset, and used
        KNN machine learning to build a model with 85% accuracy.

          transaction fees paid to miners, we can predict the variation and can predict the ups and downsof bitcoin price .
          In this post, we propose the usage of common machine learning algorithms like Linear, Polynominal, Spline, GAM, Cubic Regression &
          Extreme Gradient Boosting for predicting the price movement of the Bitcoin.

        If you ever wondered what makes a video game a bestseller, now you have a full overview of factors that make its breakout success.
        In this project, I will analyze sales data from 8K video games, identify variables most correlated to hits (games which sell over 1M units) and

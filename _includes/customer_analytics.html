    <h1>Analysis of Video Game Sales</h1>




    <h4>Introduction</h4>


    <p>
    In this project, we propose to build a model that can predict video games sales based on
    features from dataset. Emphasis is placed on video game publishers like play station which
    will helpi them predict which games will be best sellers before they are released. The data
    we used identifies games based on genre, publisher, platform, etc. giving us multiple factors
    useful for predicting a game’s success.
    The main work that we have done includes: analyzing the features of data set via datavisualization, processing the data set, using four regression model to predict the model.
    Firstly, we read in data from the data set and explore the data, getting a brief recognition of
    features in this data set. After that, we modified the data set in following ways including
    renaming, processing the missing values and integrating significant features.
    Then, we select 4 different machine learning models as candidates including linear
    regression, ridge regression, random forest regression and KNN. We use them to make
    predictions and evaluate their performance to decide which models are appropriate to be
    used for further modification.

    <h4>Data Source</h4>

    <p>
    The original dataset has games ranging from 1980 to 2020 with 11,493 different game titles.
    There are 579 publishers with 31 platforms. Games are broken down into 12 unique
    categories as follows: Sports, Platform, Racing, Role-playing, Puzzle, Misc, Shooter,
    Simulation, Action, Fighting, Adventure,and Strategy. The dataset was taken off of Kaggle,
    but originates from VGChartz, a business intelligence and research firm. Additional data has
    been provided by Metacritic which has critics’ scores, user scores, developer name, and rating
    for recommended maturity of player. The shape of dataset is (16719, 16)

    <h4>Data Cleaning</h4>

    <p>
        <b>CHANGING DATA TYPE</b> From the overall review of our data set, we can see that the
    data are in different data type. Some of them are numerical data, like user score,
    user counts, critic score and critic counts. While some of them are text data, like
    Name of game, publisher and platform. We must change the data type for our
    further work.</p>

    <p>
        <b>PROCESSING THE MISSING DATA</b> We can see that lots of game do not have the
    feature critic score and user score, which will make a vital impact on our project.
    According to this poor data set, we must fill the missing values with some rational
    data. Below figure shows missing data in the corresponding data columns.

    <ul>
        <li>Textual data: If the original data type is text, we need to fill the missing data with
            appropriate value or general text “TBD/ Unknown”.</li>
        <li>Numerical data If the original data type is numerical, we need to fill the missing data
            with this column’s mean value.</li>
        <li>Outlier: Outlier is an observation that lies an abnormal distance from other values in
            a random sample from a population. there are outliers in sales columns. They might
            be useful for training as they indicate bestseller games, but for now we are going to
            remove them and maybe add them later</li>
    </ul>

    Below figure shows the data frames after data clean up.
